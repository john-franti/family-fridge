# Family Fridge - Frontend

Family Fridge is an app for sharing important moments and accomplishments with those you are close with, simulating polaroids on a virtual fridge to bring back that old way of celebrating eachothers achievments from childhood. 

[This](https://github.com/aidanmc95/family-fridge-backend) is a link the the backend repository.

## Motivation

We wanted to create an app that allows familys to conenct in a wholesome way, especially if familys are unable to connect in person during the pandemic, that reminds them of how they would connect in childhood.
